- **PyTorch**: Used for training and fine-tuning machine learning models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For pre-trained models like Roberta and Sentence-BERT.
- **OpenAI GPT-3**: For generating witty captions.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Sentence-BERT**: Fine-tuned for text-to-template matching.
- **Roberta**: Trained for meme classification.
- **CLIP**: Used for text-to-image matching.
- **GPT-3**: Generates captions for memes.

## Data

- **Meme Dataset**: A cleaned dataset of 900k memes, including captions, labels, and image paths.

## How It Works

1. **Input Prompt**: The user enters a text prompt in the Streamlit interface.
2. **Template Matching**:
   - The system uses a classifier (e.g., SBERT, Roberta, or CLIP) to suggest relevant meme templates.
   - The user selects a template from the suggestions.
3. **Caption Generation**:
   - GPT-3 generates a witty caption based on the input prompt and selected template.
4. **Final Meme**:
   - The caption is overlaid on the template, and the final meme is displayed to the user.
